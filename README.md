# AzureAuthentication

This is a code sample to showcase how you can authenticate your request programatically with Azure.
### The authentication methods available are:
 - Authenticating by Prompting for Credentials from end user. (This needs end user interaction)
 - Authenticating by Credentials i.e. a Username and password. (This does not need any end user interaction)
 - Authenticating by using a Certificate ( This also does not need any end user interaction)

I have provided this functionality in a separate class file along with it's interface.
Download and feel free to use the AuthenticationHelper class directly in your projects. Please keept the credits in the file.

**Pre-Requisites**: Follow the corresponding steps from URL: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/
